            <h2>Languages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a>Java</a></li>
                    <p>The first programming language that I learned. I learned this in my first programming class.</p>
                <li><a>C++</a></li>
                    <p>The second programming language that I learned. I used this for some of my first projects in College.</p>
                <li><a>C#</a></li>
                    <p>The third programming language that I learned. This is where I first learned about forms. I then applied that knowledge to my Excel game.</p>
                <li><a>VBA</a></li>
                    <p>The fourth programming language that I learned. Very interesting to program in because it is built in with Excel. The features make a built in database possible or linking to an outside database possible.</p>
                <li><a>SQL</a></li>
                    <p>The fifth programming language that I learned. Not my favorite language, but it is useful to know for working with databases.</p>
                <li><a>PowerShell</a></li>
                    <p>The sixth programming language that I learned. Its interesting messing around with scripts.</p>
                <li><a>Python</a></li>
                    <p>I am currently learning Python in my free time. I think the lists in Python are very cool.</p>    
            </ul>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a>Excel</a></li>
                    <p>I learned this thoroughly while I was creating my Excel game.</p>
                <li><a>Data Analysis</a></li>
                    <p>I have always liked to analysis data, but I improved my analytical skills with the database project I had to do. I further improved it working on my Excel game.</p>
                <li><a>SQL Server</a></li>
                    <p>I learned this thoroughly while I was doing my database project.</p>
                <li><a>Troubleshooting</a></li>
                    <p>I learned troubleshooting from my dad. He works in IT. His favorite phrase to us when we asked him a computer related problem was: "Google it"</p>
                <li><a>Working in a team</a></li>
                    <p>I have enjoyed working in team environments because I like getting to know and working with people who have similar skillsets to me.</p>
                <li><a>Forms</a></li>
                    <p>I learned how to make forms in Visual Studios and Excel.</p>
